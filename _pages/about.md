 Iâ€™m a final year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Prof. Justin Domke](https://www.cs.umass.edu/~domke/). 
 
 I am broadly interested in machine learning. My research work focuses on leveraging [generative modeling approaches to build better sampling methods](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ufb1EMYAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1). 
 Recently, I was also involved in building [India's leading AI tutor app](https://padhai.ai) during time at [SigIQ.ai](https://sigiq.ai). Prior to that I spent a wonderful summer with the [Causality and Machine Learning team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/causal-inference/) at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), and another summer as an applied scientist intern with the personalization team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

Before my graduate studies, I spent four amazing years at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) acquiring background in machine learning and electrical engineering. During this time, I was mentored by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/), [Prof. Tanay Guha](https://www.tanayag.com), and [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io) (undergraduate thesis advisor).

Aside from work, I enjoy keeping myself fit, reading books, making people laugh, and playing board games. I cherish deep, philosophical discussions (including but not limited to AI and its implications :)). Feel free to reach out to me and I will be more than happy to lend an ear.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
