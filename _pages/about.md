 Hi there! I recently defended my PhD and am officially in the industry job market. I bring a _unique blend of deep technical expertise, zero-to-one product experience, and excellent communication skills._ Read more below or [set up a short call :)](https://calendar.app.google/QTqFrDE2J2pgym8F8)
 
  I recently completed my PhD in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Prof. Justin Domke](https://www.cs.umass.edu/~domke/). My work leveraged [generative modeling approaches for designing efficient sampling methods](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ufb1EMYAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

 I remain broadly interested in artificial intelligence. Recently, I led product at [SigIQ.ai](https://sigiq.ai) to build [India's leading AI tutor app](https://padhai.ai), where I managed a team of designers, engineers, and AI experts. Prior to that, I spent a wonderful summer designing generative-model-based causal models for the [Causality and Machine Learning team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/causal-inference/) at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/). I spent another summer as an applied scientist intern working on deep-learning-based ranking models for the personalization team at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).

Before my graduate studies, I spent four amazing years at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) acquiring a background in computer vision, deep learning, and generative models. During this time, I was mentored by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/), [Prof. Tanay Guha](https://www.tanayag.com), and [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io) (undergraduate thesis advisor).

Aside from work, I enjoy keeping myself fit, reading books, making people laugh, and playing board games. I cherish deep, philosophical discussions, including but not limited to AI and its implications :) Feel free to [contact me](mailto:agrawal.abhinav1@gmail.com), or [set up a quick call.](https://calendar.app.google/QTqFrDE2J2pgym8F8)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
